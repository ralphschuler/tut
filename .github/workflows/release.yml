name: Release

# This workflow builds binaries for multiple platforms and attaches them as release
# artifacts whenever a new semver tag is pushed (e.g. v1.0.0). It also runs on
# pushes to the default branch to ensure the code compiles on all targets.

on:
  push:
    # Build on any push to main/master for sanity checks
    branches: [ main, master ]
    # Build and create a release when a tag starting with v is pushed
