# Example configuration for ssh-socat-tunnel
# Copy this file to /etc/ssh-tunnel/config.yaml and adjust values as needed.

vps:
  host: "your.vps.hostname"    # public IP or hostname of your VPS
  user: "root"                 # user to connect as on the VPS
  port: 22                      # SSH port (default 22)
  ssh_key: "/path/to/id_ed25519"  # private key path used for authentication
  strict_hostkey: "accept-new"      # how to handle unknown host keys (see ssh_config)

reconnect_delay_seconds: 2      # seconds to wait before reconnecting if the tunnel drops

# TCP forwards map a public port on the VPS back to a local service.
# Each entry is of the form:
#   remote_port: <port on VPS>
#   local_host:  <host running the service>
#   local_port:  <port of the service>
# Remove or add entries as required.
tcp_forwards:
  - remote_port: 25565
    local_host: "192.168.1.50"
    local_port: 25565

# UDP forwards wrap UDP via an inner TCP connection.
# Each entry defines:
#   udp_public_port – the UDP port on the VPS open to the internet
#   local_host – address of the local service
#   local_udp_port – UDP port of the local service
#   wrap_tcp_port – an internal TCP port used on both sides of the tunnel
# Note: wrap_tcp_port must be unique and unused on the VPS and locally.
